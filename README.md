# ros2_dji_serial_bridge

ROS 2 node bridging the DJI-framed UART protocol spoken by the MCB (main
control board) with ROS 2 topics.

**Wire formats: [`UART_PROTOCOL.md`](UART_PROTOCOL.md)** — frame layout, all
five message IDs, byte tables both directions, REF_SYS bits, POSE_MSG odom
status codes. Read it before touching `dji_protocol.hpp` or any `msg/` file
that crosses the link. Changing one is a two-repo change; the MCB firmware
carries the matching structs, and `CV_MSG` and `POSE_MSG` are both waiting on
it right now.

## Topics

Five, one per message ID: `~/nav_goal`, `~/cv_target`, `~/pose`, `~/ref_sys`,
`~/relocalize`. Types and directions are in the summary table in
`UART_PROTOCOL.md`. They live in the node's private namespace, so `~/nav_goal`
is `/dji_serial_bridge/nav_goal` until a launch file remaps it.

The node has no opinion on the other end of any of them. `thornbots_pkg`'s
`mcb_relay` and the CV pipeline connect directly, remapped as needed.

## Parameters

Defaults live in `config/dji_bridge_params.yaml`, which the launch file loads
under the `/**` wildcard key. Only `device`, `baudrate` and `debug_log` are
launch arguments; the other three change only in the YAML, or via a whole
replacement file with `params_file:=`. `diag_interval_s:=0` on the command
line is silently ignored.

- `device` (string) : serial device path, e.g. `/dev/ttyTHS1`
- `baudrate` (int) : bits per second, e.g. 115200
- `read_poll_ms` (int) : poll() timeout in ms (10 is fine)
- `enforce_crc` (bool) : drop frames failing CRC (default true)
- `diag_interval_s` (int) : seconds between diagnostic summaries, 0 disables
- `debug_log` (bool) : log everything if true

## Diagnostics

Every `diag_interval_s` the node prints bytes received, frames decoded, CRC
error counts and per-topic message counts. Read it as:

| Observation               | Likely cause                                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| bytes=0, frames=0         | nothing arriving (cable? power? baud?)              |
| bytes>0, frames=0         | not framing (baud mismatch, CRC, wrong frame format)|
| bytes>0, frames>0, pose=0 | decoding, but no pose (unexpected msgType from MCB?)|
| bytes>0, frames>0, pose>0 | healthy                                             |

## Usage

The ROS package is `dji_serial_bridge`; the directory is `ros2_dji_serial_bridge`.
`colcon build --packages-select ros2_dji_serial_bridge` selects nothing and
succeeds.

```bash
ros2 launch dji_serial_bridge dji_bridge.launch.py device:=/dev/ttyUSB0 baudrate:=115200

python3 scripts/test_bridge.py                       # config + live check, 10s timeout
python3 scripts/test_bridge.py --config-only         # config check, no ROS
python3 scripts/test_bridge.py --timeout 30          # slow MCB startup
python3 scripts/test_bridge.py --device /dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate 115200
```
